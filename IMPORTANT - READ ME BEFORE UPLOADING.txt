STOP! READ THIS BEFORE UPLOADING.

1. DO NOT drag the "vromon_release" folder to GitHub.
2. Open this folder.
3. Select ALL files inside (app, components, package.json, etc).
4. Drag those files to GitHub.

If your GitHub repository looks like this:
- vromon_release / app
- vromon_release / package.json

IT IS WRONG and will fail.

It MUST look like this:
- app
- components
- package.json
(At the top level)
